## Description
The AiCore_Practicals project is designed to provide hands-on experience with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) concepts through practical exercises. The aim of the project is to help learners understand the fundamentals of AI and ML, including algorithms, data handling, and application development. Through this project, learners will gain working knowledge of reasoning in the presence of incomplete and/or uncertain information, and apply various AI search algorithms. The project also focuses on the use of Python programming in an AI environment, enabling learners to comprehend, analyze, design, and create AI platforms and solutions for real-life problems. This project has been an excellent opportunity to learn about the challenges of complex and computation-intensive problems, thereby increasing productivity and technical skills.

## Installation Instructions
To get started with the AiCore_Practicals project, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Python versions 2.7.X, 3.6.X, and 3.8.X are supported.
2. Install necessary Python libraries such as Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. This can be done using pip:
   ```
   pip install numpy scipy pandas matplotlib
   ```
3. Clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
4. Navigate to the project directory and install any additional requirements specified in the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Instructions
To use the AiCore_Practicals project, follow these guidelines:
1. Open the project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or text editor.
2. Each practical exercise is contained within its own Python script or Jupyter notebook. Begin by reviewing the README.md file in each exercise directory for specific instructions.
3. Execute the scripts or notebooks as per the instructions provided in the exercise README.md files. This can typically be done by running:
   ```
   python script_name.py
   ```
   or opening the Jupyter notebook and running the cells:
   ```
   jupyter notebook notebook_name.ipynb
   ```

## File Structure
The AiCore_Practicals project is organized as follows:
- `/exercises` - Contains individual directories for each practical exercise, including Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.
- `/data` - Includes datasets used in the practical exercises.
- `requirements.txt` - Lists all Python libraries required to run the exercises.
- `README.md` - Provides an overview of the project, installation and usage instructions, and other relevant information.
